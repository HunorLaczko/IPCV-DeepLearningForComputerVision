## Lab2

The goal of the lab: create simple neural networks from scractch using numpy

Part1: implementation of a single neuron
Part2: implementation of a network with one hidden layer for binary classification
Part3: implementation of a network with one hidden layer for multiclass classification

The code was inspired by the course: [Deep Learning Specialization by DeepLearning.ai](https://www.coursera.org/learn/neural-networks-deep-learning/home/info)

Tools: Numpy, MNIST
